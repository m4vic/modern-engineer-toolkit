# 🧰 Tools & MLOps

Tools & MLOps are essential for turning models into **real-world applications**.  
This section teaches how to:

- Build ML/DL/LLM APIs  
- Track experiments  
- Use version control  
- Deploy models  
- Containerize with Docker  
- Automate workflows  
- Use cloud services  
- Handle data pipelines  

Modern AI engineers MUST understand these tools — they are required across ML, DL, GenAI, Robotics, Quant, and AGI systems.

---

# 🧱 Prerequisites

Before starting Tools/MLOps, complete:

### 🔹 Required
- **Python** → `../Fundamentals/README.md`
- **Machine Learning Basics** → `../MachineLearning/README.md`

### 🔹 Recommended
- **Deep Learning** → `../DeepLearning/README.md`
- **Generative AI (API usage, apps)** → `../GenerativeAI/README.md`

Tools/MLOps is a **horizontal skill** — it connects to every field.
